            <p>Here at Uplifting Lives we have many departments that will allow people from in and out of our communities to participate in.
            An helping hand from the people in our South African communities do not only help children but encourage us to keep pushing towards our goal.
            This is why we have many foundations that allow the public to contribute to this organization, whether it be financially or even community service. 
            Here at Uplifting lives we understand and believe that every contribution matters and non is looked down upon so we are encouraging you to <b>Get Involved</b> in any
            way possible.<br> Here are a list of committees that you can get involved in:<br><br>
            1. One Child A Time Foundation: This foundation allows a volunteer to go through series of processes that will lead them into
            adopting a child and becoming their parent and changing their lives by offering them a loving home and future<br><br>
            2. Community Service Foundation: This foundation, volunteers can apply to help in helping take care of children mostly toddlers
            as well as helping cook nutritional meals for children and educating them on hygiene etc.<br><br>
            3. Raising Funds Foundation: This is our financial foundation where people can contribute whatever they can financially.
            As we know many people are busy with their day-to-day lives and jobs that it makes it difficult for them to physically be 
            present to offer help but through financial contributions they can still help out a lot.</p>

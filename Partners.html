            <h2>Our Partners</h2>
            <p>As one of the largest and fastest growing organizations, we have partnered with 2 large investing institutions which are
                <b>Dameburg Industries & Make a wish-children's foundation</b>.
                These two large companies play a large and vital role in the success of Uplifting Lives. They contribute financially and in many legal aspects as well which leads 
                to the edification of Uplifting Lives. 
                Yes these two companies play a huge role financially ad legally for our NPO 
                but what made us partner with them is the similar vision we shared which is the desire to change the lives of the disadvantaged youth in South Africa.
                To us here at Uplifting Lives, compassion and love should dominate over all other driving forces
                because that is the only way we can lead this organization to a big success.<p>
                
            <p>By working in partnership with the organisation, like-minded and committed corporate partners have the ability to make a real difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable people across South Africa, throughout Africa and the world. 

                In encouraging corporate partnerships, we would stress that Uplifting Lives is a reputable, trustworthy organisation, with a long and flawless delivery track-record. Corporate linkages are welcomed in terms of our:<br><br>

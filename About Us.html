                <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
                <p>Uplifting Lives is an NPO founded by its CEO, Mr Phine-Goel Nyanguila in 2023. Our CEO, Mr Phine-Goel Nyanguila began this NPO due to compassion. He has always felt a strong compassion towards children and especially to the disadvantaged ones. This led to him starting an organization to help these children, hence today we have <b>Uplifting Lives-One Child a Time. </b>The vision is to help the thousands of disadvantaged children as a means of creating better futures fo them. Here at Uplifting Lives we are fully aware that our mission is not an easy task and will require much dedication and heart to change the lives of all the the children we want to reach but with our ethical and moral structure we know we can do this and with God on our side we believe we can reach our goal.</p>

                <h3>What do we do?</h3>
                <p>We have 3 main goals here at Uplifting Lives:<br>
                    1. To reduce the current South African child food poverty rate which currently sitting at a staggering 25%.<br> We do this by supplying nutritional meals to these children as many are malnourished due to hunger. We also work hand in hand with local schools to supply school children with good breakfast and lunch meals and some canned foods to take home twice a month.</p><br>
                <p>2. To reduce the current 1/3 South African children illiterate fraction.<br> We have built 3 po our own Uplifting Lives primary schools we we will freely enroll children that do not attend school and cannot read or write. Since we have not yet built high schools, we will enroll high school  learners in the nearest schools so they can get an education</p><br>
                <p>3. To provide housing for homeless children.<br>We have built large estates where we shall house homeless and abandoned children where they will be looked after by many of our employees as parents. We work with many orphanages that allow us to adopt some children so we can help build better futures for them.</p>
